When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

   To share with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because in this way, I can choose what status to be stored on the GitHub's repository
    and this way is more easier, up-to-date is covenient to choose when or how to update.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branch used for new feature, forks for get other's GitHub's repository to my GitHub's
    repository, clones get other's or my Github's to my local repository. Branches is definite.
    Between forks and clones is that when you are a collaborator, just use clones, but not,
    use forks.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
